**Pluto: Alien Dating App**<br>
In a future where humans face extinction due to climate change and resource depletion, questions arise about whether Earth is still the best place to call home. With the discovery of planets inhabited by diverse species, interspecies relationships begin to form. Pluto is a simulated dating app designed for creatures across the galaxy, open to both binary and non-binary connections. The project explores themes of love beyond planetary boundaries and the blending of technology and human emotion in the search for connection across the universe.
